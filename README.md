iPhones do not respond to pings when they are asleep but on the network. This is a Vera UI7 plugin that determines whether or not one or more IP addresses regardless if they are computers or phones (Android or iOS) are on the network regardless of the sleeping state.

The original code came from the code (named findMyPhone-v2.6.0) developed by GadgetGuy at http://www.power-home.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=3250. My father (Ron Seese) and I developed this port of the code to the Vera UI7 platform.
